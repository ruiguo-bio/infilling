# Pop music infilling ableton live plugin

The file infilling.amxd is the ableton live plugin. Currently it needs a server backend to run the program. If you would like to test this, please send me email ruiguo0225@gmail.com to get server address.

## Basic function

This plugin works with up to 5 track for the pop genre and 4 track for the classical genre. The midi tracks in ableton should be names from track_0 to track_n. Each track should have only one clip.

This infilling tool works for at most 16 bars, and it can support more than 16 bars if a different starting bar than 1 is selected. 

## control parameters

This tool can control the following parameters:

- bar level tonal tension
- track level texture
- bar level texture

The texture includes density, occupation and polyphony. Density is the number of notes, occupation of the total duration of the notes, and polyphony is the the number of one notes or more than two notes in the track. 

The infilling region can be a track, e.g. melody in a bar, e.g. bar 3. It can be several bars, or a whole track.
