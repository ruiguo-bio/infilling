## 🎹 Basic Functionality

This plugin supports infilling for up to **3 tracks** in a pop song project. Please follow these setup guidelines:

- MIDI track names in Ableton Live should follow the format: `track_0`, `track_1`, ..., `track_n`.
- Each track should contain **only one MIDI clip**.
- The plugin supports up to **16 bars** per session. To go beyond 16 bars, set the **starting bar** to a number higher than 1.

## 🎛️ Control Parameters

You can customize the infilling behavior using the following parameters:

- **Bar-level tonal tension**

Texture is defined by three components:
- **Density** – Number of notes per bar.
- **Occupation** – Total duration of notes within a bar.
- **Polyphony** – Number of notes played simultaneously.
