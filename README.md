# Pop music infilling ableton live plugin

The file infilling.amxd is the ableton live plugin. Currently it needs a server backend to run the program. If you would like to test this, please send me email ruiguo0225@gmail.com to get server address.

## Basic function

This plugin works with three midi tracks, including melody, bass and harmony. The midi track should be named as melody, bass and harmony for the first three tracks in ableton. The plugin should be included in the melody track.

This infilling tool works for at most 16 bars, and it can support more than 16 bars if a different starting bar than 1 is selected. 

## control parameters

This tool can control the following parameters:

- bar level tonal tension
- track level texture
- bar level texture

The texture includes density, occupation and polyphony. Density is the number of notes, occupation of the total duration of the notes, and polyphony is the the number of one notes or more than two notes in the track. 

The infilling region can be a track, e.g. melody in a bar, e.g. bar 3. It can be several bars, or a whole track.
